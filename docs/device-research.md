# Device research

What is known about the devices the tool converts or might, and how it was found out,
so you need not repeat the work. To add a device, see
[adding-a-device.md](adding-a-device.md); what holds particular devices up is in
[devices/](../devices/README.md).

## By chip family

Both pages have the same sections, where the family has something to say: its
devices, their flash and layouts, a plug's identity and stores, the cloud, the
update path, what a backup logs, the stock firmware in the emulator, tools and
methods, and questions still open.

- [Espressif research](espressif-research.md): the ESP32 and ESP32-C3 devices, locked
  devices among them, their partition layouts, a plug's Sonoff identity, how a
  device's firmware name is learnt, and what a backup logs.
- [Beken research](beken-research.md): the eWeLink firmware on the BK7238 devices: its
  flash and stores, its cloud and update format, its pairing in the emulator, and
  the route to OpenBeken and ESPHome.

## By device

What was found out about one device is kept with its files, in its `research.md`, and
listed here:

- [Sonoff NSPanel](../devices/sonoff-nspanel/research.md): why its updater
  refuses the bridge's file.
- [Sonoff S61](../devices/sonoff-s61/research.md): its energy meter's calibration, its
  wiring, and what OpenBeken did on it in the emulator.
- [Sonoff Basic Gen5](../devices/sonoff-basic-1gs/research.md): its flash size.

The emulators that most of it was found with are described in [emulator.md](emulator.md)
and [tools/beken/emulator/](../tools/beken/emulator/README.md).
