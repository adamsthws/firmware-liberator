// The API's D1 database (DB in wrangler.jsonc). Made and brought up to date
// by tools/repo/cloudflare_settings.py apply, with the maintainer's token,
// never by CI, as D1 permissions reach every database in the account: it
// runs each file in migrations/ it has not run yet, in the order of their
// names, and records each in d1_migrations, as wrangler would.
// - A migration, once committed, is never changed: a change is a new file,
//   with the next number (0002_reports.sql, ...).
// - Each can be run again harmlessly (CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS): running one
//   over the API is not atomic, so one cut off part way is run again.
// - Each only adds (a table, a column, an index): the Worker deployed before
//   a migration is applied, or after, must still work.

// The newest migration this code needs (test/database.test.mjs holds it to
// the newest file in migrations/).
export const LATEST_MIGRATION = "0002_reports.sql";

// Whether the database has every migration this code needs, asked at most
// once a minute in a Worker: false until `apply` has run the newest, so a
// Worker deployed first answers 503 rather than failing on a missing table.
