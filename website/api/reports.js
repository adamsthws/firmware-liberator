// /reports: the reports the tool sends at the end of each run, unless told not
// to (tools/autoflash/report_data.py makes them), kept for the project's own
// figures: how many devices it has converted, and how reliably, by device.
// A readout sends one too for each device as its readout ends ("kind":
// "readout", held to the schema's "readout"), kept apart (readout_reports):
// how readouts end, and how many devices the computers making them converted.
//
// POST {"reports": [<report>, ...]} (application/json): the run's report, with
// any the tool could not send before. Each is held to report-schema.json, and
// carries its own proof of work, made for its id before the report existed,
// so the tool does the work while the run goes on. The answer is always
// {"accepted", "duplicate", "rejected": [{"id", "why"}], "later"}: the tool
// forgets the first three, and sends the rest again another time.
//
// Kept, and how floods are bounded:
// - Nothing of the sender in what is kept: no address (the rate limiter holds
//   it a minute; Cloudflare's log of the request, seven days, wrangler.jsonc),
//   no time of day; a report's day, as a UTC date. For the
//   figures' model names alone, a keyed hash of the address and the model it
//   names (namedBy), which ties the sender to nothing else, kept until the
//   model is vouched for (nightly.js) or VOUCH_KEEP_DAYS pass.
// - The device as a keyed hash (DEVICE_HASH_KEY_PERMANENT, a Worker secret) of the hash the
//   tool sends of its MAC, so the stored value leads back to no device
//   without the key, which never leaves Cloudflare.
// - At most REPORTS_DAILY a day from everyone, SENDER_REPORTS_DAILY from one
//   sender (sender.js: an IPv6 address by its /48), counted under a keyed
//   hash (SENDER_KEY) of its address, never the address, and DEVICE_DAILY a
//   day for one device; past the first two, the rest wait for another day
//   ("later"), so no one computer can flood the figures.
// - Nothing is taken (503) while INGEST is not "on": index.js checks it for
//   every path, before this.
// - One no run of the tool's would write (review.js) is held for review:
//   answered as accepted, kept quarantined, counted nowhere.
// - A request costs a fixed few database queries however many reports it
//   carries (D1 allows 1,000 a request on Workers Paid, 50 on the free plan): the duplicates, the
//   devices' counts for the day, the day's count, and one batch to write.
