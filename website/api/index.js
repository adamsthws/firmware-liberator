// api.firmwareliberator.com: the project's API (tools/autoflash/readout.py,
// .github/readouts.md). A Worker of its own, apart from the website's, so
// nothing sent here can touch the site. Six paths, as openapi.json describes
// them: four a POST from the tool, under /v1/ - /v1/reports (reports.js, which
// says how it is guarded), and three for readouts and sign-ups - and /confirm
// and /forget, which a person opens from an email.
// Every one answers 503 while INGEST is not "on". A sender is counted by its
// address, an IPv6 one by its /48 (sender.js).
// - /v1/wanted: whether a readout of a device would add anything, asked before
//   it is made. Its product model, firmware model and version, the stage it
//   would be (a first stage, or a whole memory), and the firmware eWeLink
//   offers it, by SHA-256: the answer says whether it is wanted, and which of
//   those files are held already, so they are left out.
// - /v1/readout: a readout, made with its owner's consent. Kept only if it adds
//   something: fewer than PER_KEY readouts of that model and version at that
//   stage are held (a whole one taking a first stage's place too), or it
//   checks those taken as right (CHECK_DAYS), and its sender has had fewer
//   than SENDER_DAILY kept today.
// - /v1/notify: an owner's email address, to be emailed as more devices are
//   supported, with their devices' models and the readouts they sent, so
//   their own devices' news can be sent them too. The website's sign-up page
//   (SITE_ORIGIN) posts an address alone to it from the browser, its script
//   doing the same work. Either way the address is sent a link to confirm
//   it, and nothing is kept until it is.
// - /confirm: that link; /forget: the link to stop, one an address. A GET of
//   either shows a page asking first; only the POST it sends acts, so a mail
//   scanner following one does nothing.
// - Readouts not taken as right are held to PENDING_BYTES, and deleted with
//   unconfirmed addresses by the nightly job after their days (pending.js).
//
// The tool is open source, so it can hold no secret: what keeps this from being
// flooded is that each request costs its sender work, and that the bucket has
// hard limits it is never let past.
// - A proof of work: SHA-256 of "<time>:<the body's SHA-256>:<nonce>" starting
//   with PROOF_BITS zero bits, about 17 million tries (10 to 30 seconds in the
//   tool's Python, once a readout), made within PROOF_AGE of now and good for
//   that body alone. Hardware made for it does that in milliseconds, so the
//   daily limits below, not this, are what bound the bucket. /wanted and
//   /notify ask lighter work (LIGHT_PROOF_BITS, a second or two) good for a
//   minute (LIGHT_PROOF_AGE), and taken once: each request is worked for
//   afresh. A device's names are taken only as a model's name is written
//   (MODEL, STOCK_MODEL, STOCK_VERSION), other text only as printable ASCII.
// - It must be a readout: a tar of at most MAX_BYTES, its first file a
//   manifest.json of the format the tool writes.
// - At most two readouts a minute from one address (READOUT_LIMIT, held by the
//   limiter, never stored), and DAILY_COUNT readouts and DAILY_BYTES a day from
//   everyone, counted in the database (counters.js), where two at once can
//   never both pass the limit. /wanted reads that count too, and says so once
//   the day is full. NOTIFY_DAILY addresses a day may be given. /wanted and
//   /notify are not held to READOUT_LIMIT, which a batch's questions would
//   use up before its readouts: the hostname's rate-limiting rule
//   (tools/repo/cloudflare_settings.py) holds them, as it does every path.
// - Until the database has every migration this code needs (database.js),
//   each path answers 503, so the tool tries again later.
// - Kept for good, with the marks of what is held (readouts/held/,
//   readouts/firmware/): a readout is kept only if it adds something, so the
//   store grows only with firmware not seen before, and an old one may prove
//   useful long after. TOTAL_BYTES of them at most, counted in the database
//   as the day's are: room enough that a flood of made-up ones, at the day's
//   limit, takes months to fill it, at well under a dollar a month (R2
//   includes 10 GB, then $0.015 a GB-month, 2026). Past it, none is taken
//   until some are deleted by hand (.github/readouts.md).
// - A device enough readouts of are in, by eWeLink's product model in ENOUGH
//   (a comma-separated variable in wrangler.jsonc), is not wanted at all.
// - The same readout sent again the same day is the one already stored.
// - A confirmed address (subscribers, in the database) has no expiry: it is
//   kept until its owner removes it through /forget. No address or other
//   detail of a sender is kept but the one they gave: a sender's day count is named by a keyed hash of its
//   address (SENDER_KEY, a Worker secret), deleted with the day's counts.
//   Cloudflare's own log of each request (wrangler.jsonc), kept seven days,
//   holds its address.
