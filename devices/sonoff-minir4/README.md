# Sonoff MINI Extreme

## Status

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fadamsthws%2Ffirmware-liberator%2Fmain%2Fdevices%2Fstatus%2Fsonoff-minir4.json)](README.md)

## Where it stops

Its stock firmware starts in the emulator, run on another device's flash as no dump of one is published, with the factory and pair records a paired one has (its firmware is Sonoff's newer "ais" SDK: [research](../../docs/espressif-research.md#sonoffs-ais-sdk)), and comes online as a paired one does. A conversion has not been tried on it yet. See [what is holding each one up](../README.md).

**A readout is safe, and wanted**: its partition table is the S60's (published from a real one by
[smeso/esp32-ptm216b](https://github.com/smeso/esp32-ptm216b)), so the bridge
runs on it as on an S60, only reads, and puts it back on Sonoff's firmware. The
copy sent in has the Wi-Fi password and eWeLink identity taken out of the records
this firmware keeps them in ([`docs/readouts.md`](../../docs/readouts.md)).

## The device

Sonoff's inline switch, the **MINIR4**. Not the MINIR4M, the Matter one, which is locked.

## Files

- **Tasmota**: the official release, unchanged, given the template in
  [`tools/autoflash/kinds.py`](../../tools/autoflash/kinds.py).
- **ESPHome**: [`esphome.yaml`](esphome.yaml); [`esphome.md`](esphome.md) says what it reports.
- **Flash layout**: expected to be the S60's; one laid out otherwise stops the run
  before anything is written.
- **Calibration**: none, as it has no meter.
- **Back to Sonoff**: the tool writes back the device's own backup, taken before
  anything of Sonoff's is written over; without it, Sonoff's official firmware for
  it, with the identity the device keeps or your eWeLink account holds
  ([how](../../docs/what-happens.md#changing-firmware-later)).
- **How it is converted**: as the S60 is ([`docs/what-happens.md`](../../docs/what-happens.md)),
  with the firmware for its chip. [`docs/adding-a-device.md`](../../docs/adding-a-device.md)
  says what was needed.
