# Sonoff BASICR4

## Status

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fadamsthws%2Ffirmware-liberator%2Fmain%2Fdevices%2Fstatus%2Fsonoff-basicr4.json)](README.md)

## Where it stops

Its firmware keeps its partition table at 0xC000, and its bootloader reads it
there; Tasmota and ESPHome, like the tool's own programs, are built to look for
it at 0x8000, so the tool does not convert it yet, and turns it down as it does
any device it does not know. Its stock
firmware starts in the emulator, on a stand-in flash with its table moved there,
and is read out. See [what is holding each one up](../README.md).

**A readout is safe, and wanted** ([`docs/readouts.md`](../../docs/readouts.md)):
the bridge (4.4.6 or later) takes the table from 0xC000 without writing anything,
only reads the device, and puts it back on Sonoff's firmware. The copy sent in has
the Wi-Fi password and eWeLink identity taken out of the records this firmware
keeps them in (its pair and factory records). It would show what nobody has seen:
the whole table, of which the stand-in guesses all past the table itself (`nvs`
from 0xD000, the rest as the S60's).

## The device

Sonoff's ESP32-C3 inline switch, model **BASICR4**.

| | |
|---|---|
| Chip | ESP32-C3 |
| Firmware name | `FWSW-E32R4-BASICR4-ESP32C3` |
| Flash | 4 MB by the header of its official update file; nobody has read one here |
| Stock model | `SN-ESP32C3-BASICR4-01`, 1.1.0 in the public file |
| Relay | GPIO4 |
| LED | GPIO6: lit high by the Tasmota template, lit low by the ESPHome sources |
| Button | GPIO9, active low |
| Zero-cross input | GPIO5: a pulse at each mains zero crossing, read for Sonoff's Magic Switch. Left unset here |
| Thermistor | GPIO3 (ADC1 channel 3), read by its stock firmware: under 580 mV it takes itself to be overheating and refuses updates. Not seen on a board yet, and read by neither the Tasmota template nor the ESPHome config here, so a converted one would lose this protection |

Pins from [Blakadder's template](https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_BASICR4.html),
which agrees with [ESPHome's device page](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/sonoff-basic-r4-v1.0),
taken from [digiblur's](https://digiblur.com/wiki/devices/relays/sonoff-basic-r4/), on
the relay, button and LED pins. They disagree on whether the LED is lit high or low;
this follows Blakadder's, which only changes when the LED is lit. GPIO5 is
[Tasmota's MagicSwitch input](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/pull/20247): the
device's zero-cross circuit drives it, so nothing here sets it as an output. Nobody
has checked the pins here, and the emulator cannot.

Blakadder's warning stands: **its circuit has no transformer, and its low-voltage side
sits at mains potential (130 V measured on 240 V mains). Never touch or connect its
pins with it on the mains.**

## Files

- **Tasmota**: the official release, unchanged, given the template in
  [`tools/autoflash/kinds.py`](../../tools/autoflash/kinds.py), without MagicSwitch.
- **ESPHome**: [`esphome.yaml`](esphome.yaml); [`esphome.md`](esphome.md) says what it reports.
- **Flash layout**: its partition table is at 0xC000; the rest is not known.
  In the emulator, [`public_dump.py`](../../tools/espressif/emulator/public_dump.py)
  puts eWeLink's official update file on the S60's flash with its table moved there,
  the factory and pair records a paired one has, and its thermistor (GPIO3) reading
  room temperature: under 580 mV it takes itself to be overheating, and refuses
  updates.
- **Calibration**: none, as it has no meter.
- **Back to Sonoff**: a readout leaves it there; the tool does not convert it yet.
- **How it is converted**: not yet. Neither Tasmota nor ESPHome needs to
  change: the likeliest way is for the bridge to write a copy of its table at
  0x8000 first, which Sonoff's bootloader and app never read, after which the
  interim Tasmota starts and the tool's usual steps put ESPHome's bootloader
  and table in place, as on any device
  ([research](../../docs/espressif-research.md#converting-a-table-at-0xc000)).
  It waits on a readout of a real one: how long its bootloader is (it must end
  below 0x8000) and the rest of its table.
  [`docs/adding-a-device.md`](../../docs/adding-a-device.md) says what adding a
  device takes.
