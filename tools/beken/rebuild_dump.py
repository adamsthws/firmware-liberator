"""Make a BK7238 plug's whole stock flash again, with no serial cable, to run it
in the emulator: a device with no public dump can be added this way.

A plug's own bootloader, partition table, radio calibration and settings are
read from it once it runs OpenBeken (GET /api/flash, backup.read_flash), and
its stock app, which the conversion overwrote, comes from the model's official
OTA file. This puts the two together as the stock bootloader would have left
them after applying that file:

    app        the official firmware, CRC-striped, with the file's RBL header
               in the partition's last 96 bytes
    download   the file's RBL from its second sector on: the bootloader erases
               only the first when it has applied one
    the rest   as read, less what the interim firmware wrote (INTERIM_WRITES)

Proven on the S61, whose public dump is the answer: see README.md, "Rebuilding
a dump". What is read carries the plug's Wi-Fi password and eWeLink identity,
and the result is Sonoff's firmware: neither ever goes in this repository.
