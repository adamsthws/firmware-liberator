#                             DHCP (the device at .50-.59), DNS and eWeLink, the local stub -
#                             in its container (autoflash-beken-emu, device-net.sh). Its flash, logs

# computer's container, AUTOFLASH_BEKEN_EMU_FLASH another whole flash under this
# checkout (rebuild_dump.py's) for a new device to start from, and image.sh's
# own (AUTOFLASH_BEKEN_EMU_PUBLISHED, AUTOFLASH_BEKEN_EMU_NO_PULL,
# AUTOFLASH_BEKEN_EMU_SOURCE_URL) where to get the image. In the container,
# AUTOFLASH_BEKEN_EMU_DUMP is the dump its tools start from. Its folders are in
