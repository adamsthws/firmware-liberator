"""The Beken fault suite: every direction, every step that writes to or waits
on the plug, every fault - on emulated Beken plugs side by side (beken-emu.sh
plug, from the public S61s dump), as tools/espressif/emulator/fault_suite.py
does for the Espressif plugs.

    fault_suite.py prep                 the starting plugs: one on the interim firmware,
                                        one on OpenBeken, one on ESPHome, converted by
                                        the tool from the dump
    fault_suite.py prep-update          the update scenarios' starting plugs: on OpenBeken
                                        and on ESPHome as an earlier release converts them
    fault_suite.py check                the final firmware, with no faults: each installed
                                        from Sonoff's, then each plug taken to the other
                                        (tools/repo/emulator_check.py)
    fault_suite.py list                 every scenario
    fault_suite.py list openbeken       those a new OpenBeken build is checked with
                                        (docs/updating-firmware.md)
    fault_suite.py batch [FILE]         the scenarios in FILE (one id a line; every
                                        scenario without), skipping those passed
    fault_suite.py report               the latest result of each
    fault_suite.py share FILE N...      FILE's scenarios shared out between machines
                                        running N emulators each, to end together:
                                        FILE.1, FILE.2, ... (--times-from DIR: another
                                        machine's suite folders, for their times)

Each scenario: a run of the tool from a starting plug (a fresh dump for
Sonoff's firmware, a saved one otherwise); when the step under test has been
going for a share of its usual time (40%, and 10% and 90% at the steps that
write), the fault; then the tool run again, as a person would - switching the
plug off and on where the run says to - until the plug is converted, or four
runs fail. Every scenario also checks the fault landed while its step was
under way (MISTIMED if not), and that the converting run's report says its
end-of-run checks passed, the emulated meter confirming the relay switched
(FAIL-CHECKS if not: tools/repo/fault_verdicts.py),
that each run left one line a stage on its screen, none of a try that
failed (FAIL-SCREEN if not), and that a plug converted to OpenBeken or ESPHome
runs this checkout's release of it (FAIL-NOT-LATEST if not).

The faults: the plug switched off for 1 or 30 s (plugoff), this computer off
the plug's Wi-Fi for 30 s (outage), the tool killed and run again after 1 or
180 s (crash), and Ctrl-C (ctrlc); at the steps that write, a power cut and
another as the tool sends it again (double: in the same run, if it sends its
command again itself), and the router giving the plug
a new address once the step is done (readdress); and at each route's
"apply", the plug switched off 10, 50 or 90% of the way through its
bootloader writing the new firmware in - timed off the plug's own output.
And at each step that sends an image the stock bootloader installs - Sonoff's
firmware's (B2) and OpenBeken's fetch of ESPHome (J2, O1) - an image it
refuses (badimage): the tool sends it spoilt once (--simulate-bad-image
STEP), fetched whole but failing the bootloader's CRC check, so the plug
starts the firmware it had again; the scenario passes when the tool sends
it again by itself and the plug is converted.

And readouts (readout_scenarios): of a plug fresh from Sonoff's firmware,
with a fault in the read and as Sonoff's firmware is put back, then what a
person does until a whole readout.tar is kept and the plug works on Sonoff's
firmware; and of a plug on OpenBeken, which must be refused.

The routes from the interim firmware start from a plug a run to ESPHome left
there, found by a new run. A plug converted through the interim firmware is
also checked: by the names it asked DHCP for, it was autoflash-recovery-CDEF
there from its first request and never OpenBeken's own name; and once ESPHome
is on it, the interim's settings are erased from its flash (interim_problems).

Each emulator is a plug of its own (beken-emu.sh --instance N: autoflash-beken-emu-N),
AUTOFLASH_BEKEN_EMU_WORKERS of them at once (default 2: each takes a core, and the
tool's runs share what is left). Sonoff's firmware restarts by itself once
it has an update, in the emulator as on a real plug
(tools/beken/emulator/README.md).

Results: captures/emulation/beken/suite/results.jsonl (AUTOFLASH_BEKEN_EMU_SUITE_DIR
for another folder), and each scenario's run
logs and the plug's serial output beside it; a scenario run again keeps its
earlier attempts' beside them, numbered (logs/<scenario>.1 the first). A fault that never happened is
NOT-FIRED, not a pass. Each result's notes say how short of memory the computer
was; a failure while it was starved prints "memory-starved", as the plug's
connections can then fail with nothing wrong.
