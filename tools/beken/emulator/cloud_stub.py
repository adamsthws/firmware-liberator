"""The emulated Beken plug's eWeLink: the local stub (tools/ewelink/stub_cloud),
served on its router's address for the plug and for the tool alike, as
bk-emu.sh plug runs it (plug-net.sh).

    python3 -I -B cloud_stub.py --state DIR --bind ADDRESS --flash DIR/flash.bin

Dispatch is plaintext on :80, as the S61's factory dispatch URL is; the IoT
WebSocket and the account API are TLS on :443, under a CA of our own made once
into DIR (ca.crt, with the leaf beside it), which the plug is made to trust
(cloud_online.StockHooks' trust-anchor swap) and the tool is given
(SSL_CERT_FILE). The plug's identity is what it says as it registers; its
hardware address, which eWeLink's record carries, is read from its flash.

Its model is what the firmware it first started holds, not what it says as it
registers: that comes from its sealed factory data, so a flash rebuilt on the
S61's settings for another model (rebuild_dump.py) says it is an S61.
