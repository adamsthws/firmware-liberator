<#
Start Autoflash, the conversion tool, on Windows - what start.cmd in the
repository's root runs, from a double-click or a terminal:

    .\start.cmd                 convert a plug (the same as: start.cmd run)
    .\start.cmd run --verbose   any of the tool's own commands and options

It runs the tool on python.org's portable Python, unpacked into .python\ in
the repository - nothing is installed. Only if that cannot be used does it
fall back to a Python already installed, and only if there is none does it
install one, quietly, for your account; it then offers to remove that again
when the tool exits.
