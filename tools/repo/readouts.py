                                                    readouts agreed on it

                                                    readouts from both sides of

    python3 tools/repo/readouts.py changes [REF]     the devices whose status changed
                                                    since REF (the latest release's
                                                    tag), and whom to tell of each

Each line is a readout's key, size, when it came in and what the Worker noted
of it: the tool, the model, and whether it holds a whole read.
Under readouts/ only the readouts are listed, not the marks of what is held
beside them; a prefix given lists everything under it.

`review` lists, by product, firmware model and version, each readout the
API has not taken as right: fewer than three of them, from three senders,
agree (.github/readouts.md); first stages each offer apart (the versions
eWeLink offered them), as each is agreed on apart. Each line is its
reference, stage, when it came in, its object and fingerprint; one whose
fingerprint differs from the rest of its key is marked ODD, and one that
came to check those taken as right, and is not alike them, DISAGREES.
`offers` lists, by key, each offer readouts agreed on - first stages or
whole ones, from three networks - with the versions offered and the day it
was. `rotated` lists, the same way, each key taken as right from readouts sent
both before and after TIME (as `cloudflare_settings.py
rotate SENDER_KEY` printed it): two of its three could be one sender's, as a
new key makes every sender look new. The API's database is read with the
maintainer's CLOUDFLARE_READOUTS_REVIEW_TOKEN (D1 is refused to CI's).

`notify` lists each address confirmed, from the API's database: its
devices (eWeLink's product model and the firmware model, as the tool last
saw the owner's account), the readouts it sent, when it was confirmed, and
the link each email to it carries for its owner to remove it. Given a
product, only that product's owners. Any address on Email Service's
suppression list for a hard bounce or a spam complaint is taken off the list
first, and how many said. `forget` takes off one address, as its own link
would: one an email sent by hand bounced from. Everyone listed is emailed
when a new device is supported (.github/readouts.md). `changes` lists each device whose
status in devices/status.json differs from REF's, with its owners: run it
when a release changes one. Never from CI, whose logs are public.
Fetch one with `npx wrangler r2 object get <bucket>/<key> --remote --file
readout.tar`, from website/, with CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, as wrangler names it,
set to the same token. It is CLOUDFLARE_READOUTS_REVIEW_TOKEN, in the
environment or .env.infra, as TOKENS in tools/repo/cloudflare_settings.py
allows it; tools/repo/cloudflare_tokens.py makes it.
