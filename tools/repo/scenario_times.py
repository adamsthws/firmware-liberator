"""How long each fault-suite scenario took when it last ran, so a batch can
start the longest first.

A batch ends when its last scenario does: one of half an hour started near the
end keeps a machine going alone while the others are done. Started first, the
long ones run beside the short ones, and the machines' end times are close
enough to share out again.

Taken from every results file a machine has kept, one to a suite's folder
(`<root>/<suite>/results.jsonl`; the Beken suite's, in beken/, are a level
further down, so each family reads its own): a row's own `seconds`, or for a
row without (the Espressif suite's before it recorded them) the time since the
row before it from the same emulator instance, whose worker runs its scenarios
one after another.
