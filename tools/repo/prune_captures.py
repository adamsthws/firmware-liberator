Only what is listed in PRUNABLE, every part of it made again by the next run, build
or prep: an emulator's plug and its computer's copy of the checkout, the suites'
logs, the build caches and the earlier releases' trees. A backup anywhere in them
is kept, as a plug's stock backup cannot be made again (AGENTS.md); so are the
starting plugs prep saved, the public dumps and everything not listed. An emulator
running keeps its state.
