"""The project's Cloudflare tokens made, or remade with new values, as TOKENS
in tools/repo/cloudflare_settings.py says.

    python3 tools/repo/cloudflare_tokens.py            every one
    python3 tools/repo/cloudflare_tokens.py KEY ...    those named, as TOKENS does

Each is made with what TOKENS allows it, or, there already, given that and
a new value, its old one then refused. The value goes straight where TOKENS
says it is kept, and nowhere else, never to the screen: a secret of the
GitHub environment (with gh, signed in), a Worker's secret, or, for a token
you use from your computer, .env.infra.

A token that can make tokens can make itself any other, so this is run with
one you make by hand, and refuses any other: one named for this, made in
the last ROTATE_MINUTES and expiring within as long, usable from this
computer's address alone, and allowed nothing but the account's tokens;
one so named but made otherwise it deletes.
This says how to make it, then asks for it at a hidden prompt: it is taken
from nowhere else, so it is never written down. What else this needs - the
zone's id, the Workers' tags, the admin Worker's secret - it does with a
helper token it makes for itself (HELPER), held in memory alone, from this
computer's address alone and for HELPER_SECONDS, and deletes the moment it
is done with it. It deletes its own token once done, even when a step
failed.
