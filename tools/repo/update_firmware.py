"""Move the firmware the tool installs to a new Tasmota or ESPHome release.

    python3 tools/repo/update_firmware.py check
        what firmware.json pins, against each project's latest stable release;
        exits 1 when either is behind

    python3 tools/repo/update_firmware.py due [--today YYYY-MM-DD]
        the release of each project now due by the settled-release rule
        (SETTLE_DAYS below), as JSON: what the firmware-update workflow takes

    python3 tools/repo/update_firmware.py tasmota [VERSION]
        pin that official Tasmota release (default: the latest) - its ESP32-C3
        app, Safeboot and factory image, from the release's page on GitHub -
        once each is shown to fit the layout the conversion builds

    python3 tools/repo/update_firmware.py esphome [VERSION] [--mover] [--new-bootloader]
        build devices/sonoff-s60/esphome.yaml with that ESPHome release (default: the
        latest) in ESPHome's own Docker image, check it, and publish it in
        artifacts/; --mover builds the mover too; --every-device builds every
        device's, as the weekly update does

    python3 tools/repo/update_firmware.py esphome [VERSION] --plug sonoff-s61
        the same for a Beken plug's ESPHome (devices/sonoff-s61/esphome.yaml, on
        LibreTiny): the rt_ota image its build makes, checked and published

    python3 tools/repo/update_firmware.py esphome [VERSION] --plug KIND
        the same for another Espressif plug's ESPHome (KIND's folder's esphome.yaml)

    python3 tools/repo/update_firmware.py esp32 [tasmota] [bridge] [recovery] [mover] [template] [tables]
        what the conversion of any plug with a classic ESP32 needs, each in a
        Docker image: official Tasmota's ESP32 files pinned from the release the
        ESP32-C3's are, the bridge and the recovery Safeboot built from this
        repository's sources, the mover and its bootloader with ESPHome

    python3 tools/repo/update_firmware.py esp32c3 [bridge] [mover]
        the same for the ESP32-C3: its bridge, built from this repository's
        sources and wrapped for the S60's stock updater, and its mover

    python3 tools/repo/update_firmware.py openbeken [VERSION] [--plug sonoff-s61] [--every-device]
        build OpenBeken for a Beken plug - upstream at that stable release (default:
        the commit pinned, else the latest release), this project's patches (the 4 MB
        table, the hook before an OTA's restart), its driver and the plug's
        table for it - in this project's build image, check it, and publish it
        in artifacts/

Each writes firmware.json, the published files and SHA256SUMS, and lists what
is left to do by hand. Nothing is pushed or committed. docs/updating-firmware.md
is the whole procedure, and what each check is for.
