"""Each emulator run's outcome, for the admin view's emulator figures
(website/admin/emulator.js): how many runs, of which device and firmware, how
many passed, and what failed - never a run's report or log, which stay on the
machine that ran it.

    emulator_stats.py send DIR...    send what the suites in DIR kept unsent
    emulator_stats.py check          whether this computer can send: its
                                     credentials, and the admin view taking them
    emulator_stats.py push [HOST...] this computer's credentials copied to each
                                     HOST (ssh), else to EMULATOR_STATS_HOSTS's

Every suite of every chip family - fault, attended and the final-firmware
check alike - calls began() as a batch begins, with how many scenarios its
suite has for the device and how many it runs (what the view's share of a
device's scenarios passed is of), and record() (fault_run, attended_run,
check_run) for each scenario's run as it writes its own result, saying
whether the scenario had run in that folder before (`rerun`): a batch runs
what has not passed yet, and its re-runs would read as a worse pass rate.
Each is kept in the suite's results folder (UNSENT, UNSENT_BATCHES) and sent
at once, beside the suite, so the figures fill as runs end and a machine
thrown away loses none sent. send() as the batch ends sends whatever is
left. A run that could not be sent (no
network, no credentials) goes with the next one, or by `send`, up to the admin
view's OLDEST_DAYS. AUTOFLASH_EMU_NO_STATS=1 keeps and sends none, as in the
tests (tests/no_network.py).

Sent with Access's service token for the suites, which never expires and can
send runs and do nothing else. tools/repo/cloudflare_settings.py makes and
rotates it, and writes it to CREDENTIALS, one file a computer that every
checkout on it reads - a new worktree too - and pushes it to each machine
EMULATOR_STATS_HOSTS names (.env.infra: your own machines, never committed).
A file of its own: not .env, the tool's, nor .env.infra, the maintainer's
tokens that change the project's services, which stays on the maintainer's
computer. The environment's EMULATOR_STATS_CLIENT_ID and
EMULATOR_STATS_CLIENT_SECRET win over it. Without either nothing is sent,
said as the batch ends.
