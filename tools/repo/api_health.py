"""Whether the project's API is well, as the cloudflare-settings workflow checks it daily.

    python3 tools/repo/api_health.py snapshot    the public figures are fresh, and of today's schema
    python3 tools/repo/api_health.py usage       the account is well within what its plan includes
    python3 tools/repo/api_health.py mail        the API's emails bounce rarely, and draw no complaint
    python3 tools/repo/api_health.py live [on|off]  the API just deployed answers as it should

`snapshot` needs no token: it reads the public figures the API Worker writes
each night (website/api/nightly.js), and fails if they are missing, older than
SNAPSHOT_AGE, or written by a database short of the newest migration
(website/api/database.js) - which is how CI, whose token is refused D1,
notices a migration not yet applied.

`usage` reads the account's use from Cloudflare's analytics, with
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (CI's read token, which needs Account Analytics: Read):
this month's Workers requests, D1 rows and R2 operations to yesterday, and
what D1 and R2 hold, each against what the account's plan includes a month
(INCLUDED: Workers Paid since 2026-11-10, and R2's own free allowance). It
fails at WARN_AT of any, so the maintainer hears long before a bill: past
what is included, each is billed, not stopped. Any error Cloudflare's
analytics give is said in full.

`mail` reads what came of the emails the API Worker sends (website/api/mail.js
counts only what happens as it sends): from Email Service's analytics, how
many of the last MAIL_DAYS' were delivered and how many bounced; from the
account's suppression list, the addresses added since COMPLAINT_DAYS ago for
a spam complaint or a hard bounce. It fails when the bounces pass
BOUNCE_WARN, Cloudflare's own mark for a sender's good standing (once there
are MIN_BOUNCES, so one mistyped address among few emails does not), or on
any complaint: Email Service pauses an account's sending for poor
reputation. Counts only, as CI's log is public: never an address. With
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CI's read token, which needs the zone's Analytics:
Read and the account's Email Sending: Read.

`live` is the website workflow's last step of deploying the API Worker, and
needs no token. It asks the API what only a deployed, migrated Worker with
its database answers rightly: a GET of /confirm with a token that cannot be
one (the firewall's GET path, the Worker, the database's newest migration:
a page saying there is nothing to confirm), and a POST to /wanted with the
light proof of work but of a format no tool sends (the firewall's POST path,
the proof checked and taken once in the database: 400). Nothing is counted
or kept but that proof's mark. Deployed taking no requests (`off`), each is
to answer 503. It tries for LIVE_WAIT, as a new version takes some seconds
to be everywhere.
