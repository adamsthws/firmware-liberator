"""Run a whole conversion unattended, and keep the screen it drew for review.

    python3 tools/repo/unattended_run.py [--size 100x40] [--save DIR] [--command readout] [-- run options...]

The conversion (autoflash/cli.py run --unattended) runs on a terminal of its
own (a pseudo-terminal), so it draws exactly what a person would see - the
colours, the stage lines redrawn in place, the notes taken away once read.
Everything it writes is recorded, and afterwards the screen as it was left
is rebuilt from the recording and printed, colours and all.

The eWeLink account comes from .env (see .env.example), as does this
computer's sudo password where sudo would ask for one.  Anything after `--`
goes to the run itself: --device-ip, --new, --verbose and so on. --command
readout makes a readout instead (cli.py readout --unattended), as the fault
suites' readout scenarios do.

Saved, under captures/unattended/<time>/ unless --save says otherwise:
    screen.ansi   the final screen, with its colours: `cat` or `less -R` it
    screen.txt    the same without colours, to read or compare anywhere
    screen.raw    every byte written, as written: `cat` replays it in a terminal
    result.txt    how the run ended, as its report has it in the run's log
                  (its Result): the screen says it above the report instead
    clipboard.txt what the run put on the clipboard, if it put anything: a
                  stand-in for the clipboard tool takes it, leaving this
                  computer's clipboard alone

Linux and macOS only (Windows has no pseudo-terminal of this kind); there,
start.cmd run --unattended runs a conversion just as unattended, unrecorded.
