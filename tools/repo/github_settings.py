Through gh, logged in as an admin of the repository. `apply` changes only
what differs, and of the checks before main (the second ruleset) requires
only those that have run on main, saying which are left: a check required
before its workflow is there - a new job, or one renamed - would hold every
pull request back, the firmware-update workflow's too. Run it again once
they have run. A secret's value cannot be read back, so only its name is
checked, and one not written here is deleted. `apply` leaves a missing one
to `secret` - or a Cloudflare token to tools/repo/cloudflare_tokens.py,
which makes it and sets it.
