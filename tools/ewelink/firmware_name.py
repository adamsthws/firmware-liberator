"""The firmware name a device's stock updater checks, learned without the device.

A Sonoff update file starts with a wrapper naming the firmware it is for
(FWSW-E32S60-S60-ESP32C3FN4). The updater refuses a file with another name, and
the names vary too much to guess, so they are read: from the file eWeLink offers
the device, or else from the filenames of the public update files, which carry
them. eWeLink goes by the device's id, not its model, so it can only say this for
a device in the account, which is all a run needs. Only the first bytes of an
offered file are fetched, and neither its link nor the device's id is logged or kept.

learn() never raises: a run goes on without the name. Nothing here sends anything
to a device.
