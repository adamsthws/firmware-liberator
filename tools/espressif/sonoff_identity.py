"""A plug's Sonoff identity: what of Sonoff's settings makes it the device its
eWeLink account knows, kept so that the plug can go back to Sonoff's firmware
with no backup on the computer.

It is a few entries of Sonoff's NVS, 300 to 550 bytes: frame_params (the
device's id, its key, model and kind), data_backups (a copy of them), and on
some devices productId, channel_params or PID. Not its Wi-Fi - frame_params'
ssid and passwd are left out, as is ESP-IDF's own - nor its histories, logs,
radio calibration or the eWeLink certificates a POW Elite caches.

On Tasmota's layout the tool keeps it in one sector of its own at the very top
of the flash (SECTOR_AT), after Tasmota's filesystem: a partition entry names
it, and the sector says what it is itself - a magic, a version, a length and a
checksum - so it is found even if a reflash loses the entry. Leaving Tasmota,
it goes back into the settings the next firmware has (nvs()), where ESPHome
keeps it as it keeps Sonoff's own.

Where the plug has none, it is rebuilt from the device's eWeLink account record
(from_account), which has the id, the key, the model and the kind. What the
record lacks Sonoff's firmware does without: frame_params' sha256, which it
sends neither in its dispatch nor its register, and the other entries
(docs/device-research.md says how that was shown).
