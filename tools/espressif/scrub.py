"""Take what is the owner's out of a copy of a device's whole flash before the
copy leaves the computer (tools/autoflash/readout_espressif.py): its Wi-Fi network's
name and passwords, and its eWeLink identity, replaced by made-up values of the
same shape.

ESP-IDF keeps the station's password and its PMK in NVS (nvs.net80211:
sta.pswd, sta.pmk; the soft AP's as ap.passwd, ap.pmk), and Sonoff's own
settings keep the password again (frame_params "passwd"). NVS never erases an
entry in place: one replaced is only marked so, and its old bytes stay, so a
password the device had before is still there. So every entry of those names is
blanked whatever its state, and then every copy of each password found anywhere in the flash but the firmware images, Sonoff's own published
code: a password there is the firmware's, its setup network's. The network's
name goes the same way: the station's (sta.ssid, every one an entry replaced
has left), Sonoff's own copy (frame_params "ssid") and every other copy. The
soft AP's name (ap.ssid) is the device's own setup network, not the owner's,
and the identity below already takes the device id out of it.

Sonoff's settings name the device to eWeLink (frame_params: deviceid, apikey,
encrypt_key, devicekey). Each is replaced throughout the flash by a made-up
value of the same length and form, as tools/espressif/emulator/public_dump.py
makes the public test plugs, which boot and convert in the emulator: the
identity only matters to eWeLink's servers, which an emulated copy never meets.

Each settings entry changed has its checksums made good again, so the copy
still starts as it was, on a device or in the emulator.
