# Espressif tooling

The tooling for Espressif plugs, the ESP32-C3 and the classic ESP32. What it was
worked out from is in [docs/espressif-research.md](../../docs/espressif-research.md).
The tool imports some of it during a run; the rest are scripts of their own, for
research, firmware builds or the emulator.

**The emulator**: how to use it is in
[docs/emulator.md](../../docs/emulator.md#the-espressif-emulator), and how it works in
[emulator/](emulator/README.md).

## Chips, layouts and identity

- **`chips.py`** - what differs from one Espressif chip to the next: where its
  bootloader goes, what Tasmota's files for it are called, and the firmware
  published for it.
- **`layouts.py`** - the partition tables Sonoff's firmware comes on, and where each
  keeps things.
- **`sonoff_identity.py`** - what of Sonoff's settings makes a plug the device its
  eWeLink account knows, kept so that it can go back to Sonoff's firmware with no
  backup on the computer.
- **`nvs_image.py`** - an ESP-IDF NVS partition, written as `nvs_partition_gen`
  writes one, with Python's standard library alone.
- **`ais_records.py`** - the factory and pair records Sonoff's newer "ais" SDK
  (the BASICR4's and MINIR4's firmware) keeps its eWeLink identity and Wi-Fi in,
  where the S60's keeps `frame_params`.

## Reading a plug

- **`flashmap.py`** - what a whole-flash dump holds, read from the dump itself: its
  chip, its partition table (at 0x8000, or 0xC000 where its firmware is built so),
  and the MAC from its eFuses.
- **`device_facts.py`** - what a backup says about a plug, for the run's log.
- **`scrub.py`** - takes what is the owner's out of a copy of a whole flash before
  a readout leaves the computer.
- **`flash_readout.py`** - reads a stock plug's whole flash over Wi-Fi, then puts it
  back to stock.
- **`dump_stock_flash.py`**, **`inspect_stock_nvs.py`** - imaging a stock plug's flash
  through the bridge, and finding where its firmware keeps its Wi-Fi (research only).
- **`capture_tasmota_template.py`** - Tasmota's default settings from a converted
  plug, as a template.

## Sonoff's update wrapper

- **`build_vendor_ota.py`**, **`analyze_vendor_ota.py`** - the 100-byte wrapper a stock
  updater takes, built around an ESP app, and checked.
- **`serve_tasmota_ota.py`** - serves a checked, wrapped app to one owned plug.
- **`check_ota_firewall.sh`** - checks the router rules that send a plug's update
  request to this computer.
- **`RECOVERY_LOCK`**, **`REPARTITION_LOCK`** - while each is there, the tools that
  update a stock plug, and the server that replaces its partition table, refuse to
  run. Each says what to check before it is moved.

## Firmware built here

- **`firmware-build.Dockerfile`** - what builds the bridge and the recovery
  Safeboot, with PlatformIO (`tools/repo/update_firmware.py esp32`).
- **`safeboot/`** - the recovery Safeboot, its migration and the checks every phase
  of it shares.
