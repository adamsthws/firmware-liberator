"""Attended runs in the emulators: the tool run as a person sits through it,
every question asked and answered as a scenario's answer set says
(tools/repo/unattended_run.py --attended), and the screen judged at every
answer and at the end - what the fault suites cannot see, as they run the
tool unattended.

A scenario is a JSON file in tools/espressif/emulator/attended/ (an S60's,
in the Espressif emulator) or tools/beken/emulator/attended/ (an S61's):

    {"about": "what it shows",
     "start": "fresh" | a saved device (unattended-test.sh --from),
     "prep": [...], "args": [...], "size": "100x40", "minutes": 30,
     "answers": [{"when": regex, "type": keys, "times": n, "optional": bool}, ...],
     "expect": {"exit": 0, "result": "Converted", "screen": true, "shows": [regex, ...],
                "never": [regex, ...]},
     "again": {"answers": [...], "args": [...], "expect": {...}}}

`again`: the tool run once more on the device as the first run left it, with
no --new - a run stopped part way, offered back ("did not finish") - judged
as the first is.

`prep`, before the run, on the device (Espressif only): ["convert", FIRMWARE]
first, if at all (the device converted to it, unattended); "sudo forgets" (sudo
remembers no password in the emulator, so it asks again at every use - the
end of the run too); ["tasmota password", PASSWORD] (Tasmota's web password
set); ["locked esphome", "login" | "login and updates"] (this project's
ESPHome with a web login, admin and "test-login-1", and the made-up API
encryption key LOCKED_KEY; and with "updates", taking only encrypted
updates). An answer is typed at its question only (unattended_run.Answer);
one `optional` need not be asked. In place of `type`, an answer can switch
the device ("power": "off") or its home Wi-Fi's router ("router": "off", or
on the Beken emulator "on NEW-PASSWORD", the password changed), move the
computer onto the device's own network or back ("wifi": "join", "home"), or
signal the run ("signal": "TERM").
`command`: "readout" for a readout, not a conversion; `api_enough`: true
for the API beside the emulator to have enough readouts of the device's
product already (AUTOFLASH_API_ENOUGH), so a readout of it is not needed.

The verdict, from the recording alone (judge):
    PASS              ended as expected, every answer typed, nothing wrong
    FAIL-RESULT       ended otherwise: its exit code, or its report's Result
                      (the recorder's result.txt, from the run's log)
    FAIL-UNANSWERED   it ended at a question no answer covers: new, or reworded
    FAIL-UNUSED       an answer never typed: its question no longer asked
    FAIL-QUESTION     as a question was answered: no "(q to quit)" on it, a
                      row the terminal wrapped itself, or a question shown
                      twice - an earlier try left on the screen
    FAIL-SCREEN       the screen it ended on: its stages (unattended_run.stage_problems),
                      its report and how it ended (end_problems, with what the
                      run put on the clipboard), a row the terminal wrapped
                      itself, or a line `expect`'s `shows` wants not on it, or
                      one its `never` wants nowhere: on the screen at any
                      answer, or at the end - a key pressed by accident,
                      echoed

    tools/espressif/emulator/attended_suite.py list
    tools/espressif/emulator/attended_suite.py run [NAME ...] [--workers N] [--first-instance N] --device MAC

Its results, and each run's recording, go to captures/emulation/attended/<time>/.
Run on a computer with the emulators (docs/emulator.md); each scenario runs
on an emulator of its own, --workers at once - the S61's after, one at a
time - numbered from --first-instance (61) to one per worker, each started
afresh: a run uses no more instance numbers than it has workers.
