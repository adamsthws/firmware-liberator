"""The board around an emulated Espressif plug's chip: its serial port, and its
power meter, which measures a load while the relay that switches it is on.

plug-supervisor starts QEMU through this (`board.py --chip esp32c3 --kind
sonoff-s60 -- qemu-system-riscv32 ...`): it adds QEMU's serial ports, each a
socket it serves, and a QMP monitor, through which it reads the chip's GPIO
registers. Run from the checkout's copy in the container (/work), as the
redactor and the cloud stub are, so changing it needs no new image. Python's
standard library only, as the container has nothing else.

What the chip's UARTs send and receive goes where the firmware has routed
them, as on the plug's board:

- UART0 always reaches the console - the serial log - as its IOMUX pins keep
  their function whatever else it is routed to (ESPHome's driver notes the
  same of a real chip).
- A UART whose TX the GPIO matrix routes to the meter's input pin is heard by
  the meter; one whose RX takes the meter's output pin, through the matrix or
  that pin's IOMUX function, hears it. The meter's pins come from the kind's
  Tasmota template (tools/autoflash/kinds.py), which is how the plug is wired.

The meter is the chip the template names: a CSE7766 (the S60, the POW Elite),
which sends a frame of readings about every 55 ms by itself, or a CSE7761 (the
Dual R3, the POWCT), which answers register reads. Each channel measures
LOAD while the relay the template gives it is on - the GPIO's output set and
enabled - and nothing while it is off; the mains voltage is measured on the
supply side, so it is there either way. The POWCT's clamp is not switched by
its relay: it reads LOAD whatever the relay does.

The baud rate and frame format a UART is set to are not checked: a firmware
reading the meter at the wrong speed would still get its frames.

Every input pin idles high (plug-supervisor), but those a kind's board holds
low (HELD_LOW): a pin the firmware reads to know which board it is on.
