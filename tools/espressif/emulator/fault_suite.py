"""The fault suite: every direction, every step that writes to or waits on the

    fault_suite.py report                 the latest result of each

Add --stub-cloud to prep/batch to run against a local eWeLink stub per emulator
(emu.sh --stub-cloud): fully offline, no cloud lock, every scenario in parallel
on AUTOFLASH_EMU_STUB_WORKERS emulators (from AUTOFLASH_EMU_FIRST_INSTANCE,
default 1). Without it the real cloud is used and the cloud scenarios take
turns, as below.

Each scenario: a conversion from a saved device; when the step under test has
been going for a share of its usual time (40%, or 10% and 90% at the riskiest
steps), the fault; then the tool run again, as a person would - switching the
device off and on, or joining its own network, where the run says to - until
the device is converted, or four runs fail. Every scenario also checks the fault
landed while its step was under way (MISTIMED if not), that the run left
no firewall rule and no helper behind, and that the converting run's report
says its end-of-run checks passed (FAIL-CHECKS if not: tools/repo/fault_verdicts.py),
and that each run of this checkout's tool left one line a stage on its screen,
none of a try that failed (FAIL-SCREEN if not).
And readouts (readout_scenarios, go_readout): of a device fresh from Sonoff's
firmware, faulted in the read and as Sonoff's firmware is put back, until a
whole readout.tar is kept and the device is back on Sonoff's; of a device on
Tasmota, which must be refused; and of every device in an account
(readout_all_scenarios, go_readout_all), on the stub, each sent to the API's
own code (in a container beside the emulator) and judged by what it
answered and kept.

How many at once, from the environment:
    AUTOFLASH_EMU_CLOUD_WORKERS     emulators for the scenarios that need eWeLink (from
                                    instance 1); each run and its device use the cloud only
                                    in its turn, and are side by side otherwise. Six

                                    logged to connections.log on the real cloud (2; 0 for
                                    none)
    AUTOFLASH_EMU_MOST_WORKERS      start up to this many of those instead, of which the
                                    number in <AUTOFLASH_EMU_SUITE_DIR>/workers take
                                    scenarios when that file is there: a batch scaled

    AUTOFLASH_EMU_NO_CLOUD=1        a machine whose devices never reach the internet: only
                                    the scenarios that do not need it
    AUTOFLASH_EMU_SUITE_DIR         where results go (captures/emulation/suite; with
                                    --stub-cloud, captures/emulation/suite-stub)

Results: results.jsonl, a log per scenario, and what a failure leaves (its
run records and the device's serial output). A fault that never happened is
NOT-FIRED, not a pass; NO-INTERNET when it never happened because this computer
could not reach eWeLink, which says nothing of the tool or the device, and is run
again. Each row's notes say how short of memory the computer
was; a failure while it was starved prints "memory-starved", as the device's
connections can then fail with nothing wrong.

    lostanswer-once (D1): the upload takes, its answer never arrives.
    seven-times (D4, F4, G1): the device switched off and on 7 times, which
        erases a Tasmota's settings; seven-advised (D1): Tasmota cannot join
        the home Wi-Fi, and that is done when the run advises it.
    nohook-run (F4): Tasmota will not take F4's name and template at the save.
    nohook-cut (F4tp): that, and the device switched off for a second at 10, 50
        and 90% of the restart after F4 sent the template itself.
    F4rs: a power cut or crash at F4's reset, at 10, 50 and 90% of it.

        this checkout's tool, over the same captures, as a person updating
        their checkout would - its bundle and pins that release's; and (step
        "start") a device that release converted, then taken on by this one.
    blips-3, lossy-phase (BLIP_STEPS): two 3 s outages from 10% to 90% of a
        Berry phase, or one packet in ten lost for all of it: converted with
        no step tried again, or FAIL-RETRIED.

        factory image uploaded through Tasmota's page (go_lostapp), then the
        tool, to Tasmota, ESPHome or Sonoff; lostapp-switched: only switched
        to its safeboot, its Tasmota unharmed, which must be started again,
        never replaced.
    notemplate-generic: a converted device's template replaced with Tasmota's
        generic one, and an MQTT host set, as a person might (go_notemplate);
        then the tool, to Tasmota, ESPHome or Sonoff.
    bootloop-fallback: a device converted to Tasmota, then put on its
        fallback module, as Tasmota does in a boot loop (go_bootloop): it
        must still run its own template (BAD-TEMPLATE).
    safemode-ten: a device converted to ESPHome, switched off within a minute
        of starting ten times, which ESPHome takes for a boot loop and starts
        in safe mode (go_safemode); then the tool, to ESPHome, Tasmota or
        Sonoff: it must know the device for ESPHome in safe mode, not the mover
        (FAIL-TAKEN-FOR-MOVER).
