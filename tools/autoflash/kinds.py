"""The kinds of device the tool converts, and what is each one's own.

What differs from one kind of device to the next is kept here: how eWeLink and
its stock firmware name it, the model its maker's updater wants a file
wrapped for, its wiring for Tasmota, what its ESPHome calls itself, and what
a person calls it.  The firmware published for a kind is pinned where it is
used, each file named for the kind it is for: its installer
(tools.autoflash.routes.espressif.installer.BRIDGE_OTA, wrapped for its updater), its ESPHome and the
bootloader built with it (routes.espressif.images.IMAGE and BOOTLOADER), and
its maker's partition table (SONOFF_TABLE there).  The final firmware's names are the
same for every kind - tasmota-abcdef, esphome-abcdef, openbeken-abcdef - so the
kind is told by what else each firmware says, which renaming the device
leaves alone: Tasmota's template, ESPHome's comment, and the answer
OpenBeken's driver gives (openbeken.kind).

A run keeps the kind it converts (its "device_kind"): from the eWeLink account
(A1), from what the stock firmware says it is (A2), or from a converted
Tasmota's template.  The kind names its chip family, which is whose steps the
run takes (tools/autoflash/routes).  Official Tasmota's template is named after the kind,
and ESPHome's comment by the image made for it; every firmware part way
through a conversion is the tool's own, the same for every kind.

Espressif devices have one route (tools/autoflash/routes/espressif), whichever
chip they have (tools/espressif/chips.py). Beken devices have another.
docs/adding-a-device.md says how to add a kind.

How far each kind is proven is kept in devices/status.json, alone: the READMEs'
badges read it from GitHub, and the tool from here.
