"""A readout of a Beken (BK7238) device the tool does not convert yet.

A BK7238 has one app area, not two, so reading its whole flash means
installing firmware that replaces Sonoff's for a few minutes, then putting
Sonoff's back. This installs a pin-free OpenBeken (artifacts/openbeken-readout,
which drives nothing on an unmapped device), reads the flash through it, and
has it fetch the device's own Sonoff firmware back - the file eWeLink offers
the device, the same the stock bootloader would apply.

Nothing is written until the offered file's partition table is checked to be
the 4 MB BK7238 one the readout OpenBeken is built for: on any other table its
AutoflashRevertToStock would refuse, and the download slot could be wrong.

Each stage leans on the conversion's own helpers, with their retries: the
firmware is delivered through eWeLink (tools/ewelink/ota_push), the flash read
in paced, retried chunks (tools/autoflash/openbeken.read_flash), the revert
served until the device has every byte (routes/beken/onward.serve_to_device).
The copy is anonymised (tools/beken/scrub.py) before anything is sent.

Proven end to end on the emulated S61 - the round trip, the device back
online in eWeLink, the flash anonymised - and not yet run on a real Beken
device.
