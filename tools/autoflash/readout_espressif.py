"""A readout of an Espressif device the tool does not convert yet: one with a
chip there is a bridge for (an ESP32-C3 or a classic ESP32).

Its Sonoff updater is sent the bridge alone, wrapped under the firmware name
eWeLink gives the device: the bridge goes in the spare app slot, reads the
whole flash, and has already chosen Sonoff's slot again for the next start, so
switching the device off and on puts it back as it was, settings and pairing
kept. Only what was in the spare slot is lost (often the Sonoff version before
the last update).

The copy is anonymised (tools/espressif/scrub.py): its Wi-Fi passwords taken
out, as far as its settings show them, and its eWeLink identity replaced by a
made-up one, so it still starts in the emulator as the device did. The copy
kept on the computer, as the device's Sonoff backup, is the device's own,
untouched.

Each stage leans on the conversion's own helpers: the bridge sent as the
conversion sends it (tools/espressif/serve_tasmota_ota.py), and found as it is
found (routes/espressif/installer.py).
