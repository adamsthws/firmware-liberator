"""Each run's report, sent to the project's API when the run ends
(website/api/reports.js), so how well the tool converts each device can be
counted: what report_data.py makes, never anything of the person, their
computer or their network. A readout sends one too, for each device, as its
readout ends (begin_readout, send_readout): one kind of readout report,
however many devices a sitting reads out.

- On by default; off with --no-report, AUTOFLASH_NO_REPORT=1 (the environment
  or .env), in the emulator, and for a dry or simulated run. The first time
  the tool runs on a computer it says so, once.
- The API asks each report for its proof of work, made for the report's
  random id before the report exists (proof_of_work.py): begun as the run
  begins, in a process of its own at the lowest priority, so it is done
  long before the run ends and never slows it.
- A report is kept on this computer (QUEUE) before it is sent, and removed
  only once the API has answered for it, so a run whose network was down, or
  whose window was closed, has its report sent at the next start. KEEP at
  most, each for KEEP_DAYS.
- Sending happens beside the run, as its report is read: nothing waits on
  it, and nothing of it is said on the screen, only in the run's log.
