"""This tool's firmware updated on a device it converted: from an earlier release
of the image published for the device's kind to this one, sent as the firmware
takes any update of its own, the device's settings kept.  The way a fix
reaches a device that nothing else builds for: an ESPHome no dashboard has
adopted, or an OpenBeken carrying this tool's driver and flash layout, which
upstream's own builds do not.  Official Tasmota updates itself, from its own
page; it is offered the release this tool installs too, so that running the
tool again updates any device it converted.

Each family sends the image its own way and checks it arrived; what is
shared is here: which device is offered the update, and what it says once it
has it.  One is offered it only when its firmware says it is this tool's
for its kind at an earlier version (RELEASE).  An ESPHome is also passed
over where its API is encrypted, which ours never is, or where it is a build
this project did not publish (published_builds): one adopted into an
ESPHome dashboard, with a key or without, is that dashboard's to update - the
published image would take away its changes and any key.  Its owner can ask
for that (--replace-own-build, replace_own_build).
