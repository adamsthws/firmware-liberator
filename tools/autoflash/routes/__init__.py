"""The route a run takes: from what the device runs to the firmware asked for,
as a list of steps.  Settled once at the run's start, then kept in STEPS
for the run.

Every route begins with A0, what has to be in place.  A device still on
Sonoff's firmware is then found in its eWeLink account (A1), which says
what kind of device it is, and only then is the firmware chosen (A3): which
firmware a device can have is its chip family's.  A converted device says its
kind by what it answers as, so its route is whole from the start.

The steps are a chip family's (FAMILIES, by the kind of device's family): a
package under here with the same handful of names - FIRMWARES, SOURCES and
steps_for(firmware, source) for its routes, none of them beginning with the
steps shared here, and what the runner needs to know of each step:
POINT_OF_NO_RETURN, DESTRUCTIVE_STEPS, RETRY_STEPS, ERASED_CHECK_STEPS,
STAGE_NAMES, TARGET_STAGE_NAMES, PLAIN_DESCRIPTION, ATTEMPTED_EVIDENCE,
STEP_VERIFIERS (each step its verifier doubts is done again, unasked),
SONOFF_FROM_BACKUP (whether going back to Sonoff's firmware needs
the device's own backup; where it does, sonoff_without_backup(ctx, source)
says what it can use instead once chosen, or None), RESUME_CHECK, what a resumed run checks first (or None),
and published_version(kind, firmware), the release of this tool's own build
of `firmware` it installs, if any, which a device on an earlier release of it
is offered as an update (routes/update.py).
