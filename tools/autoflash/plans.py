"""Plans: what the device is to write, for the plan phase to carry out.

The Tasmota route has a hand-written Berry program per phase. Every other
change of firmware is a few of the same moves - check the device is laid out as
expected, write some bytes and read them back, clear a region, restart - so
each is a plan, run by one Berry program (tools/espressif/safeboot/repartition/berry/plan.be.tmpl):

- the device checks its partition table and which slot it runs from first;
- a streamed write fetches one 4 KiB block at a time from this computer,
  writes it (skipping a block already right, so a resumed plan rewrites
  nothing it finished), reads it back, and sends what it read back here to be
  compared byte for byte;
- a whole write (the bootloader, a partition table, the boot selection) is
  fetched and checked in full before its first byte is written, so nothing
  waits on the network while the device cannot start, and the old bytes are
  put back if a sector does not read back right;
- an erase clears a region and checks it is clear;
- a copy moves bytes already on the device from one place to another, each
  sector read back, then the whole compared with where it came from - for
  what this computer does not have (the device's settings, say).

Each plan's data travels to the phase server on standard input, never as a
file: some holds the Wi-Fi password (an imprinted image) or the device's own
secrets (a Sonoff backup).
