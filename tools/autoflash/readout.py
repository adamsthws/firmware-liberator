"""A readout: a copy of a device's whole memory, to help add a device this tool
does not convert yet, sent with its owner's consent to firmwareliberator.com.

Nothing is converted. A readout comes in two stages. The first is only ever
read: what the device and eWeLink say it is, and the firmware eWeLink offers
it, fetched as Sonoff's own updater would fetch it; nothing is sent to the
device. A device the tool has not seen gets that alone. The second reads its
whole memory, and only on a listed kind whose status says it is proven not to
leave the device unable to start (kinds.Status.reads_out), under the firmware
name that kind's own firmware has: an Espressif device through the bridge,
which leaves Sonoff's firmware where it is (readout_espressif.py); a Beken
device through a readout OpenBeken, which puts Sonoff's firmware back
(readout_beken.py). Either way the copy is anonymised before anything is sent,
and the device is left on its Sonoff firmware.

This is what both share: the device found in the eWeLink account and on the
network, what it reports, and the readout packed, offered and sent - for one
device, or for every device in the account the tool does not convert, each
read and sent on its own (run_all), so the website can turn down one it has
enough readouts of.
