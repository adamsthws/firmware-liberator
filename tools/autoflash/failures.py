"""What kind of failure stopped a run, for its report: one of CLASSES, from
the words the run stopped with.

A report says where a run stopped and why in words written for the person;
the class says the same in a word that can be counted across runs. Classed
here, by the words, rather than at each place a run can stop, so the message
stays the one thing each place writes. tests/autoflash/test_failures.py reads
every message the tool raises and fails on one no pattern matches.
